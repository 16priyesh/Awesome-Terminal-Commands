# Contributing

This repository contains general purpose commands which are often used by unix or linux users working on a Terminal. It has been created for beginners and the explanations for various commands have been given keeping that in mind.


### How to contribute

- Create an issue if you want to suggest any commands you think are used often enough and should be added to the list.
- Feel free to make Pull Requests to fix issues or add new commands. Keep the following things in mind while contributing if you want your PR to be accepted.
    - Add only really useful commands.
    - Don't give combinations of different commands for different use cases(Unless they are usually always used together).
    - If you add any flags to the command, explain what each flag individually does.
    - Don't make your explanations too technical. This repository is for newbies. Example - `touch` command although has a vast usecase, is generally only use to create empty files.(See what the README says about `touch` command.)
    - Maintain the general design pattern of the README file - The size of the heading, the way of explaining commands and the linebreaks between related and unrelated commands. Note that this is **important** or your PR will NOT be accepted.
